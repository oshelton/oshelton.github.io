<P class="mb-4">
	This is the profile/portfolio site of Jack Owen Shelton (there's a little picture of me in the top
	left). If the name and face doesn't ring a bell you are probably in the wrong place.
</P>

<P class="mb-4">
	This site is dedicated to various parts of my life and projects I have worked on over the years
	and giving visitors a better picture of who I am.
</P>

<P class="mb-8">At some point it may even host a blog.</P>

<Heading tag="h5">Thank you for visiting and enjoy your stay!</Heading>
